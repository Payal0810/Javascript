You are developing an online shopping website, and you want to implement a discount system based on the total purchase amount. Write a JavaScript program using if statements and operators that calculate and display the total cost after applying a discount. The discount rules are as follows:

a- If the total purchase amount is $100 or more, apply a 10% discount 
b- If the total purchase amount is between $0 (inclusive) and $99.99 (inclusive), apply a 5% discount.
c- If the total purchase amount is less than $50, no discount is applied.


Input
200
Expected Output
180
Explanation
The amount is $200, so a 10% discount is applied: 200 - (200 * 0.10) = 180.


Input
80
Expected Output
76
Explanation
Explanation: The amount is $80, so a 5% discount is applied: 80 - (80 * 0.05) = 76.


Hints:
a- Use if-else statements to check the total amount and determine the appropriate discount.
b- Convert percentage values to decimal form (e.g., 10% becomes 0.10) for the discount calculations.
