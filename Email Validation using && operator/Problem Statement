You have already completed the email validation program using "||" operator. Now modify the code and rewrite the conditions to validate the email using the "&&" operator.



Additionally, include one more condition that:
a- Email should have at least 3 characters before “@.”
b- If the email is valid, store the value of the email in the result variable with a welcome message. If the email is invalid, store the string "invalid email" in the result variable.
Expected Input
 xyz@gmail.com
Expected Output
 Welcome xyz@gmail.com to our site
Expected Input
 xz@gmail.com
Expected Output
 invalid email
Test Cases
Dot should be at least 4 characters after "@": Ensure that the dot " . " in the domain name appears at least 4 characters after the "@" symbol. This means there should be at least three characters between "@" and the dot (e.g., @abc.).
Check for a valid email: Verify that the function correctly identifies and processes a valid email by including the email in the output message.
Check for an invalid email: Verify that the function correctly identifies and outputs "invalid email" for an invalid email.
Check for the size of the email: Ensure that the email has at least 3 characters before the "@" symbol.
Check for the "@" symbol: Ensure that the email contains the "@" symbol and that it is positioned correctly.
Check for the length after the dot: Verify that there are at least 2 characters after the last dot " . " in the email domain.
