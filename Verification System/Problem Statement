Write a JavaScript function named checkEligibility that takes an integer input age and checks if the user's age meets the eligibility criteria. The function should return a string indicating whether access is "granted" or "denied" based on the following conditions:



1. If the user's age is 18 years or older, return "granted"

2. If the user's age is less than 18 years, return "denied"



Input
17
Expected Output
denied
Input
22
Expected Output
granted


Hints:
a-Use an if-else statement to check whether the age meets the eligibility criteria.

b- Make sure to test your function with different values to ensure it works correctly in all scenarios with the help of the "console.log". 


Note:
You will be given a function with inputs already provided as parameters (inside the parentheses of the function). Do not create or assign values to these inputs inside the function.



For example, if the function is written like this:


You should write your code only between the lines let answer; and return answer;
Use the inputs provided (param1 and param2) to write the required logic. The test cases will automatically provide values for these inputs, so you donâ€™t need to define them yourself.
You will learn about functions in detail in upcoming lectures. For now, focus on writing the logic inside the given function.
